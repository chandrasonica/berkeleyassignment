couponAssignment.ipynb is the main Jupyter Notebook and data folder contains csv file format data.

At high level carry out & Take Out has highest acceptance ratio more then 70%, cheap resturent < 20$ also has similarer acceptance but little less, its follwed by Coffee House. Bar has least acceotnace.
On Sunny days cheap restirents has really high acceptance and coffee house was oreferred on rainy days.
Coffee house was oreffrerd by older people and bar was pfreffred by younger users.
ALso intresting point to note was that overall acceptance rate we really high when weather was cold, but there were more coupons sent on hot days.
I see that bar coupon acceptance was high for the users who visited bars 1-3 times, 4-8 also had good acceptance raio vise.

Bar coupon had 41% acceptance, within that go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 was high.
I did similar analysis on cheap resturant coupon. I notoved that cheap resturent coupons are more accepte in sunny weather, and also in younger aged users.
