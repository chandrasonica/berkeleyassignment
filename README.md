couponAssignment.ipynb is the main Jupyter Notebook and data folder contains csv file format data.

At high level carry out & Take Out has highest acceptance ratio more then 70%, cheap restaurant < 20$ also has similar acceptance but little less, its followed by Coffee House. Bar has least acceptance.
On Sunny days cheap restaurants has really high acceptance and coffee house was preferred on rainy days.
Coffee house was preferred by older people and bar was preferred by younger users.
Also interesting point to note was that overall acceptance rate we really high when weather was cold, but there were more coupons sent on hot days.
I see that bar coupon acceptance was high for the users who visited bars 1-3 times, 4-8 also had good acceptance ratio vise.

Bar coupon had 41% acceptance, within that go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 was high.
I did similar analysis on cheap restaurant coupon. I noticed that cheap restaurant coupons are more accepted in sunny weather, and also in younger aged users.
